Not the worst template bootstrap I've ever made. Picked the best parts out of H5BP, gulp, livereload, sass, bootstrap and bourbon

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/precise54/front-end-template.git

npm install

gulp
```

Now open http://localhost:8080/index.html, make sure you've got a livereload extension running in your browser and get cracking.
